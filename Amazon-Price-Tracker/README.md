# Amazon price tracker
This project aims to start with a list of Amazon UK product URLs and returns price change data to the user. 

An API for Amazon UK products was considered, but required either an advertising developer account or was not available freely. 
Therefore a webscraping method was developed instead using BeautifulSoup.
